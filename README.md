### Testimonials

-   **VS Code Accordion**
    - A React (typescript) project to mimic the behaviour of VS Code accordion which you can see in vscode explorer.
    - Accordion is resizable and take and available height present in the explorer.
    - The most challenging part was to calculate the height when more than 1 accordion are in open state.
    - From this project I learned about DOM manipulation in React.
